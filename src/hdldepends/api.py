"""Public, importable Python API.

Wraps the same building blocks the CLI uses (:func:`~hdldepends.config.build_resolver`
+ :meth:`~hdldepends.resolver.Resolver.compile_order`) behind a single
:func:`analyze` call that returns the compile order as an in-memory,
JSON-safe :class:`AnalysisResult` instead of writing a file.

:func:`select_top` and :func:`apply_forced_init_files` also back ``cli.py``'s
``-o compile-order*`` handling, so the top-selection precedence and the
forced-init-files behaviour are defined exactly once and shared by both
entry points.
